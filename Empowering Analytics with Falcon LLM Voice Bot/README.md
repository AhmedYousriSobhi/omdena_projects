## Project Information
Source: https://omdena.com/chapter-challenges/abu-dhabi-open-data-intelligence-empowering-analytics-with-falcon-llm-voice-bot/

## Project Background
The project, Abu Dhabi Open Data Intelligence, aims to harness the power of Falcon, an LLM developed by the Technical Innovation Institute in Abu Dhabi, to enhance analytics capabilities and insights derived from Abu Dhabi’s open data (https://data.abudhabi/opendata/).

## The Problem
The Abu Dhabi Open Data Intelligence project, in collaboration with the Omdena community, approach to empower analytics with Falcon LLM. By leveraging Falcon LLM, the project aims to develop a voice/text engine for advanced data analytics using Abu Dhabi’s open data. Ethical considerations and responsible AI practices are central to the project, which will follow an iterative development approach and prioritize knowledge sharing within the project community.

The development of a user-friendly application using Streamlit or Gradio will provide an interactive interface for users to explore the voice/text engine’s capabilities. Regular progress updates, blog posts, and a final presentation will highlight the accomplishments and outcomes of the project.

## Project Goals
- Foster a collaborative environment through weekly core meetings and task-wide meetings to discuss progress, challenges, and ideas. 
- Leverage Falcon LLM to develop a voice/text engine for advanced data analytics using Abu Dhabi's open data. 
- Ensure ethical considerations and responsible AI practices throughout the development and implementation process. 
- Follow an iterative development approach, continuously improving the voice/text engine based on feedback and experimentation. 
- Develop a user-friendly application using Streamlit or Gradio to provide an intuitive interface for interacting with the voice/text engine.
